Firstly I'd like to highlight the strengths I possess that I feel are suited well for this role:-

I’m highly curious in nature and have a love for learning. I love to explore and try out new technologies and ideas to implement them in my side projects and apart from that I’m well sound with the technologies I mentioned above.

I’m a huge productivity advocate and I believe in solving a problem efficiently rather than brute-forcing to the solution. I’m able to write efficient code using my sound knowledge of data structures and algorithms. 

After working on a startup and numerous other projects, I’ve gained the experience of being aware of what code I am writing, and I’m also aware of the possible bugs and challenges that can occur throughout the development process

And lastly, I always keep a positive approach to every possible situation I ever faced, and I’ve learned how to quickly adapt to the conditions that are thrown at me. I love communicating with people and learning stuff from them and gaining experience from their experiences.

Since I am a fresher, I am still learning. But I can vouch for the fact that I am a fast learner. I am always open to learn and unlearn at the same time. Unlearning as in letting go of outdated practices and ideas and moving on to more advanced procedures. I have some fresh and raw ideas that I would like to discuss with the management here if I make through, and I am sure they will like a few of them. Hiring me can be a mutually beneficial arrangement for this company and me.
